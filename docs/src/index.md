# ElectroPhysiology.jl: A Comprehensive Toolkit for Electrophysiological Data Analysis

## Introduction

Electrophysiology, the study of the electrical properties of biological cells and tissues, plays a pivotal role in understanding the physiological mechanisms underlying neural and muscular functions. As neuroscience and related fields evolve, leveraging computational tools becomes increasingly essential to manage and interpret complex electrophysiological data effectively.

ElectroPhysiology.jl is designed to serve as a robust, intuitive suite of Julia packages tailored for researchers and clinicians in the field of electrophysiology. This ecosystem facilitates the seamless integration of data handling, analysis, visualization, and modeling of electrophysiological experiments. By providing a structured approach to data through our core structure, the Experiment, ElectroPhysiology.jl empowers users to streamline their workflows, from raw data acquisition to sophisticated data analysis and theoretical modeling.

### Key Features: 

- Unified Data Structure: Centralize your experimental data into a coherent, easily navigable format with the Experiment object, designed to standardize electrophysiological datasets across various research scenarios.

- Advanced Analysis Tools: Utilize PhysiologyAnalysis.jl for comprehensive statistical analysis and data interpretation capabilities that extend your insights into complex biological phenomena.

- Dynamic Visualization: With PhysiologyPlotting.jl, transform your data into insightful visual representations, enhancing both the understanding and presentation of your results.

- Flexible Modeling Options: Explore theoretical and computational models with PhysiologyModeling.jl, an optional but powerful tool for simulating and predicting electrophysiological behaviors under diverse experimental conditions.

## Package composition

This module is composed of several different modules. You can load some or all of the modules based on what you need. 

- ElectroPhysiology.jl provides the basic reading and access to electrophysiology data
     - [ElectroPhysiology Methods](@ref)
- PhysiologyAnalysis.jl provides some analysis tools and plotting tools for analysis
     - [PhysiologyAnalysis Methods](@ref)
- PhysiologyPlotting.jl provides plotting and visualization tools. 
     - [PhysiologyPlotting Methods](@ref)

In general, if exporting PhysiologyAnalysis.jl or PhysiologyModeling.jl, ElectroPhysiology.jl doesn't need to be exported, and many of the things exported with ElectroPhysiology.jl will be left "under the hood". However if some of the tools included in ElectroPhysiology.jl are needed (see ElectroPhysiology tools), then it may be best to import both.
